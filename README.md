# **Scroll Speed Adjuster Windows11-AutoHotKey**

A **lightweight AutoHotKey script** that lets you dynamically change your **system-wide mouse scroll speed** on Windows 11 using customizable hotkeys.
Perfect for users who need precise scroll control across browsers, code editors, spreadsheets, or games.

---

## 🧩 **What This Does**

This script directly adjusts the Windows scroll-wheel sensitivity via system parameters.
It cycles between four customizable scroll-speed presets, allowing instant switching between slow, medium, and fast profiles.

---

## ⚙️ **Features**

* Written in pure **AutoHotKey** — no dependencies.
* Four scroll-speed presets *(default: 5, 12, 18, 25)*.
* Cycle or reset instantly with hotkeys.
* Works globally across all Windows 11 apps.
* Lightweight — runs silently in the background.
* Tray notifications display current scroll speed.

---

## 🚀 **Quick Start**

1. Install [AutoHotKey](https://www.autohotkey.com/).
2. Download this repository and open `ScrollSpeedAdjuster-Windows11-AutoHotKey.ahk`.
3. Double-click the script to run it.
4. Use **F19** to cycle through scroll speeds *(5 → 12 → 18 → 25 → 5)*.
5. Press **F20** to instantly reset the scroll speed to **5 lines per notch**.
6. Right-click the green **H** tray icon → **Exit** to close the script.

## 🖱️ **Razer Synapse Integration**

This script is pre-mapped for **Razer Synapse** users — ideal for mice like the **Razer DeathAdder V2 X Hyperspeed** or similar.

In **Razer Synapse**, assign:

* **F19** → *Upper side button* (formerly Mouse Button 5)
* **F20** → *Lower side button* (formerly Mouse Button 4)*

These function keys are generated by Synapse (they don’t exist on standard keyboards), letting AutoHotKey detect the side buttons safely without conflicting with Windows inputs.

If you use **Logitech G Hub**, **Corsair iCUE**, or another tool, simply map two spare buttons to F19/F20 — or edit the script for custom keys.

## 🧠 **Customization**

You can open the `.ahk` file in Notepad or any text editor to adjust:

* **Hotkeys** used for cycling/resetting scroll speed.

**Default configuration:**

```ahk
Preset values
presetValues := [5, 12, 18, 25]

Hotkeys
F19::CycleScrollPresets()
F20::SetScrollLines(5)
```

To modify presets, simply change the numbers in the array or swap the key binds to your preference.

---

## ⚙️ **Notes**

* Works globally across all applications.
* Uses the Windows `SystemParametersInfo` API for instant sensitivity changes.
* Lightweight and portable — no installation required.
