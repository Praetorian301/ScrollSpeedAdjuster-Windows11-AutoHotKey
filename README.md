## üñ±Ô∏è Razer Synapse Integration
This script is configured for **Razer Synapse** users, particularly those with a **Razer DeathAdder V2 X Hyperspeed** or similar device.

In **Razer Synapse**, assign:
- **F19** ‚Üí *Upper side button* (previously Mouse Button 5)  
- **F20** ‚Üí *Lower side button* (previously Mouse Button 4)  

These virtual keys don‚Äôt exist on standard keyboards ‚Äî Synapse generates them so AutoHotKey can detect your side buttons without conflicting with system inputs.

If you‚Äôre using other software (e.g., Logitech G Hub, Corsair iCUE), map your preferred buttons to **F19** and **F20**, or edit the script directly to use other keys.

## Customization
You can open the `.ahk` file in **Notepad** or any text editor to modify:
- The **hotkeys** used for cycling or resetting scroll speed  
- The **preset values** for scroll sensitivity  

By default:
- **F19** cycles between **5, 12, 18, 25 lines**  
- **F20** resets the scroll speed to **5 lines**

Example:
```ahk
; Preset values (adjust these as desired)
presetValues := [5, 12, 18, 25]

; Hotkeys (change to any keys you like)
F19::CycleScrollPresets()
F20::SetScrollLines(5)
